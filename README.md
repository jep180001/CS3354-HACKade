# CS3354-HACKade
### Developers: Abir Zaman, Bridgette Bryant, Chayanin Noramuttha, Huyen Huynh, Jung Park, Nicolas Torres, Mackenzie Salinas


## Welcome to HACKade!

This is a project created for our Software Engineering course - CS 3354 at UTD during Fall 2022.

### Our Goal
In this final project, our aim is to create educational games to help kids have a close interaction with different Cyber Security topics such as capture the flag, defending against hackers, network collapse, creating a defensive software, etc. Here are the following game modes we plan on implementing in HACKade:
- ***Capture the Flag***: You have to capture a little flag before the gray/black hackers, possibly in a maze.
- ***Defend the Crown***: Basically a tower defense mode, you have to defend against waves of attackers using defenses.
- ***Network Collapse***: you will have to run with files to deliver them while the network is being hacked and hackers will try to corrupt your path and stop you.
- ***Cyber Attack***: All out battle between you and hoards of hackers.

### Our Motivation
An education-based corporation is looking for ways to expose elementary school kids to various branches of computer science, such as Cyber Security. The game will expose kids to these topics through a common interest. It will introduce things to be wary of on the Internet and weaknesses in computer systems.


### Team Members & Roles:
We came up with these flexible roles to ensure overall quality, synergy, and design for our four levels in HACKade. Although they are very flexible as we are an agile and adaptive team ready to help each other when needed!
