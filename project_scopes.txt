HACKade Game

In this final project, our aim is to create educational games to help kids have a close interaction with different Cyber Security topics such as capture the flag, defending against hackers, network collapse, creating a defensive software, etc. Here are the following game modes we plan on implementing in HACKade:

Capture the Flag -- User has to capture the flag before the gray/black hackers do, while also navigating a maze.
Defend the Crown -- It is a tower defense mode, where the user has to defend against waves of attackers using certain defenses.
Network Collapse -- User has to deliver files while the network is being hacked and hackers will try to corrupt the user's path and stop the user.
Cyber Attack -- All out battle between a user and hoards of hackers.

Along with these game modes, the user will also have the option of viewing the current highest scores, tutorials explaining how each game works, and choosing their own unique character skin.
