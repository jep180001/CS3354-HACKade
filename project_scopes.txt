HACKade Game

In this final project, our aim is to create educational games to help kids have a close interaction with different Cyber Security topics such as capture the flag, defending against hackers, network collapse, creating a defensive software, etc. Here are the following game modes we plan on implementing in HACKade:

Capture the Flag -- You have to capture a little flag before the gray/black hackers, possibly in a maze.
Defend the Crown -- Basically a tower defense mode, you have to defend against waves of attackers using defenses.
Network Collapse -- you will have to run with files to deliver them while the network is being hacked and hackers will try to corrupt your path and stop you.
Cyber Attack -- All out battle between you and hoards of hackers.
